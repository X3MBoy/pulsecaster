A PulseAudio based podcasting application

Thanks to Harry Karvonen for his Python ctypes-based bindings for
PulseAudio.  Thanks also to JÃ¼rgen Geuter for helping me understand
distutils and contributing some fixes.


INSTRUCTIONS
============

If you are looking at the source, 'cd' to the top of this project and
then run the following command to try it out:

$ cd pulsecaster
$ python ui.py


INSTALLING
==========

The easiest way to use this application is to simply install it using
your platform's preferred tool set.  To install it using Fedora, run
the folowing command:

  pkcon install pulsecaster

To install it on another flavor of Linux, check the documentation for
your particular distribution.

To install directly from this source code, use the handy "distutils"
script that's provided:

$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install


GSTREAMER
=========
The pipeline for capturing from a running PulseAudio source:

gst-launch pulsesrc device-name='<NAME>' \
	   ! vorbisenc quality=0.5 \
	   ! oggmux \
	   ! filesink location=foo.ogg
