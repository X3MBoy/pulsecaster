A PulseAudio based podcasting application

Thanks to Harry Karvonen for his Python ctypes-based bindings for
PulseAudio.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

This project is only in its infancy right now. There is much that is
broken or missing.  For now, 'cd' to the top of this project and then
run the following command to try it out:

$ cd /some/path/pulsecaster
$ PYTHONPATH=$PWD python pulsecaster/ui.py
